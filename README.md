TWD-Grading-System
==================

Grading application for BCITâ€™s Technical Web Design Program, which will be used by its admins, instructors and students. Technologies used include C#, ASP.NET, MS SQL Server, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.

To see it in action: http://twd.whiterabbitdev.com

To Install:

- Copy contents into empty Visual Studio ASP.NET MVC 4 WEB APPLICATION.
- Install full Nuget package online (http://nuget.codeplex.com/releases/view/118318)
- Currently the project is configured to a private database connection. This will need to be re-configured according to your DB connection string in the Global.aspx file. 
- Each Entity Framework reference in the application will need to be changed to suit your database. Once obtained, a refactor should do the trick. 

Enjoy!
